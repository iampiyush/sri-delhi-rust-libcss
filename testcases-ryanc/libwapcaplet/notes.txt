libwapcaplet c version:
maintains a copy of unique string only.
returns a reference to the unique string.


NOT utilizing hash values internally for comparision

* why ARCRW?

* isequal is incorrect:
need to compare the hash value, not memory locations

* is_caseless_equal: similar, performs unncessary string comparision
unncessarily complicated.


* string_intern() uses expensive string comparison.
Need to use hash values to compare strings

* minimize the use of copy and clone

argument passing: use reference whenever possible. currently pass by
value.
