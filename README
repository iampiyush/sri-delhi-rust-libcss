Measuring Performance with respect to netsurf-libcss C build.
# 1 Building Libcss
make
# 2 Entering test cases directory
cd test/libcss
# 3 Building test cases 
make
# 4 copy test binary to performance measuring folder
cp select-auto ../utils
# 5 Entering performance directory
cd ../utils
# 6 Build performance measuring binary
make 
# 7 copy netsurf-libcss C implementation with name "test_select-auto"
# Download netsurf and build libcss test case , search and copy test_select-auto
# 8 Do performance test 
./perform_test_avg
